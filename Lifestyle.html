			  was one of Rome's most important dictators and he was murdered by his
			   own senators during a meeting in 44 BC near the Largo Argentina 
			   archeological site. This unique event sees dozens of actors and 
			   actresses dress up in Roman togas and engage in animated discussions
			    before dealing Julius Caesar the final blow</p>
