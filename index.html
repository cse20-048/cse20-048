	<p>Rome (Italian and Latin: Roma [ˈroːma] is the capital city and a special comune of Italy
		(named Comune di Roma Capitale), as well as the capital of the Lazio region.
		The city has been a major human settlement for almost three millennia. 
     2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2,it is also the country's most populated comune. 
		It is the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. 
		It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a population of 4,355,725 residents,
		 thus making it the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its metropolitan area is the 
		 third-most populous within Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the 
		 Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City
		  (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries 
		  of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason Rome has 
		  sometimes been defined as the capital of two states.
		Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at 
		around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it one of the oldest 
		continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from a 
		mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital 
		of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the 
		first ever Imperial city and metropolis.It was first called The Eternal City (Latin: Urbs 
		Aeterna; Italian: La Città Eterna) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the 
		expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" 
		(Capital of the World). After the fall of the Empire in the west, which marked the beginning
		 of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy, and in the 
		 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870.</p><br>
